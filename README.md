2. New registration → Name: `microsoft-graph-mcp`
3. Supported account types: Personal + Work/School
4. Authentication → Allow public client flows: Yes
5. API permissions → Add these delegated permissions:
   - Mail.ReadWrite
   - Calendars.ReadWrite

cd microsoft-graph-mcp
uv sync
```

### 3. Authentication

```bash
# Set your Azure app ID
export MICROSOFT_MCP_CLIENT_ID="your-app-id-here"

# Run authentication script
uv run authenticate.py

# Follow the prompts to authenticate your Microsoft accounts
```

### 4. Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "microsoft": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/xylex-group/microsoft-graph-mcp.git",
        "microsoft-graph-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MICROSOFT_MCP_CLIENT_ID": "your-app-id-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or for local development:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "microsoft": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/microsoft-graph-mcp",
        "run",
        "microsoft-graph-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MICROSOFT_MCP_CLIENT_ID": "your-app-id-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Multi-Account Support

All tools require an `account_id` parameter as the first argument:

```python
# List accounts to get IDs
accounts = list_accounts()
account_id = accounts[0]["account_id"]

# Use account for operations
send_email(account_id, "user@example.com", "Subject", "Body")
list_emails(account_id, limit=10, include_body=True)
create_event(account_id, "Meeting", "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z", "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z")
```

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Type checking
uv run pyright

# Format code
uvx ruff format .

# Lint
uvx ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes .
```

## Example: AI Assistant Scenarios

### Smart Email Management

```python
# Get account ID first
accounts = list_accounts()
account_id = accounts[0]["account_id"]

# List latest emails with full content
emails = list_emails(account_id, limit=10, include_body=True)

# Reply maintaining thread
reply_to_email(account_id, email_id, "Thanks for your message. I'll review and get back to you.")

# Forward with attachments
email = get_email(email_id, account_id)
attachments = [get_attachment(email_id, att["id"], account_id) for att in email["attachments"]]
send_email(account_id, "boss@company.com", f"FW: {email['subject']}", email["body"]["content"], attachments=attachments)
```

### Intelligent Scheduling

```python
# Get account ID first
accounts = list_accounts()
account_id = accounts[0]["account_id"]

# Check availability before scheduling
availability = check_availability(account_id, "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z", "2024-01-15T18:00:00Z", ["colleague@company.com"])

# Create meeting with details
create_event(
    account_id,
    "Project Review",
    "2024-01-15T14:00:00Z",
    "2024-01-15T15:00:00Z",
    location="Conference Room A",
    body="Quarterly review of project progress",
    attendees=["colleague@company.com", "manager@company.com"]
)
```

## Security Notes

- Tokens are cached locally in `~/.microsoft_mcp_token_cache.json`
- Use app-specific passwords if you have 2FA enabled
- Only request permissions your app actually needs
- Consider using a dedicated app registration for production

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication fails**: Check your CLIENT_ID is correct
- **"Need admin approval"**: Use `MICROSOFT_MCP_TENANT_ID=consumers` for personal accounts
- **Missing permissions**: Ensure all required API permissions are granted in Azure
- **Token errors**: Delete `~/.microsoft_mcp_token_cache.json` and re-authenticate
